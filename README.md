- **Authentication & Security**: Incorporates robust security protocols using AWS to ensure safe handling and storage of user data.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Developed using **Flutter** to deliver a seamless experience across various mobile devices.

## Technologies Used:
- **Frontend**: Flutter, ensuring a smooth and responsive user interface.
- **Backend**: Python, responsible for server-side logic, API handling, and secure data management.
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** for secure data storage, authentication, and scalable cloud solutions.

## App Workflow:
1. **User Registration**: Citizens register and authenticate using their NIC within the app.
2. **Document Upload**: Users can upload important documents like NIC and other government-related paperwork.
3. **Government Services**: Digital access to various government services such as taxation, legal documentation, and other civic services.
4. **Verification**: Automated processes for document validation and verification.

## Future Enhancements:
- **Biometric Integration**: Potential addition of facial recognition or fingerprint authentication for enhanced security.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Plans to support regional languages to improve accessibility.
- **Service Expansion**: Further digitalization of more government institutions and their respective services.

This app aims to streamline the interaction between citizens and government institutions, reducing paperwork and promoting digital transformation in Pakistan.
